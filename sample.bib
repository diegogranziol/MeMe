	Abstract = {We obtain the maximum entropy distribution for an asset from call and digital option prices. A rigorous mathematical proof of its existence and exponential form is given, which can also be applied to legitimise a formal derivation by Buchen and Kelly (J. Financ. Quant. Anal. 31:143--159, 1996). We give a simple and robust algorithm for our method and compare our results to theirs. We present numerical results which show that our approach implies very realistic volatility surfaces even when calibrating only to at-the-money options. Finally, we apply our approach to options on the S{\&}P 500 index.},

	Abstract = {The foundations of Statistical Mechanics can be recovered almost in their entirety from the principle of maximum entropy. In this work we show that its non-equilibrium generalization, the principle of maximum caliber (Jaynes, Phys Rev 106:620--630, 1957), when applied to the unknown trajectory followed by a particle, leads to Newton's second law under two quite intuitive assumptions (both the expected square displacement in one step and the spatial probability distribution of the particle are known at all times). Our derivation explicitly highlights the role of mass as an emergent measure of the fluctuations in velocity (inertia) and the origin of potential energy as a manifestation of spatial correlations. According to our findings, the application of Newton's equations is not limited to mechanical systems, and therefore could be used in modelling ecological, financial and biological systems, among others.},

A rigorous mathematical proof of its existence and exponential form is given, which can also be applied to legitimise a formal derivation by Buchen and Kelly (J. Financ. Quant.

We present numerical results which show that our approach implies very realistic volatility surfaces even when calibrating only to at-the-money options. Finally, we apply our approach to options on the S{\&}P 500 index.},

In this work we show that its non-equilibrium generalization, the principle of maximum caliber (Jaynes, Phys Rev 106:620--630, 1957), when applied to the unknown trajectory followed by a particle, leads to Newton's second law under two quite intuitive assumptions (both the expected square displacement in one step and the spatial probability distribution of the particle are known at all times). Our derivation explicitly highlights the role of mass as an emergent measure of the fluctuations in velocity (inertia) and the origin of potential energy as a manifestation of spatial correlations. According to our findings, the application of Newton's equations is not limited to mechanical systems, and therefore could be used in modelling ecological, financial and biological systems, among others.},

We present numerical results which show that our approach implies very realistic volatility surfaces even when calibrating only to at-the-money options. Finally, we apply our approach to options on the S{\&}P 500 index.",

abstract="The foundations of Statistical Mechanics can be recovered almost in their entirety from the principle of maximum entropy. In this work we show that its non-equilibrium generalization, the principle of maximum caliber (Jaynes, Phys Rev 106:620--630, 1957), when applied to the unknown trajectory followed by a particle, leads to Newton's second law under two quite intuitive assumptions (both the expected square displacement in one step and the spatial probability distribution of the particle are known at all times). Our derivation explicitly highlights the role of mass as an emergent measure of the fluctuations in velocity (inertia) and the origin of potential energy as a manifestation of spatial correlations. According to our findings, the application of Newton's equations is not limited to mechanical systems, and therefore could be used in modelling ecological, financial and biological systems, among others.",

In this work we show that its non-equilibrium generalization, the principle of maximum caliber (Jaynes, Phys Rev 106:620--630, 1957), when applied to the unknown trajectory followed by a particle, leads to Newton's second law under two quite intuitive assumptions (both the expected square displacement in one step and the spatial probability distribution of the particle are known at all times). Our derivation explicitly highlights the role of mass as an emergent measure of the fluctuations in velocity (inertia) and the origin of potential energy as a manifestation of spatial correlations. According to our findings, the application of Newton's equations is not limited to mechanical systems, and therefore could be used in modelling ecological, financial and biological systems, among others.",
